# Future Ready Lynden

Created a WordPress experience to provide the Lynden community with facts about a bond to renovate the aging public high school building. This project provides resources and validated information in an easy to digest manner to voters so they have the equipment to make an informed decision when voting.

## Needs

The Lynden community was facing an upcoming school bond measure, but public discourse was scattered across social media, leading to potential misinformation. The Citizens for Lynden Schools needed an independent, non-district informational website to serve as a central, trusted source of facts.

The goal was to create a neutral, fact-based resource that would:
- Address common questions and dispel misinformation.
- Shift the conversation from emotional debate to trusted information-sharing.
- Support informed voter participation.

The site needed to be informational, not promotional, and serve as an accessible "off-ramp" for community members seeking clarity.

## My Solution

I managed the entire build from start to finish. My role included setting up the hosting environment with Hostinger, managing the domain and DNS through Cloudflare, and building the site on WordPress. To meet the project's unique needs, I crafted a theme and wrote custom code (PHP, JavaScript, and CSS). The centerpiece of this custom development was a property tax calculator. This tool allows homeowners to enter their property's assessed value and instantly see their estimated monthly and annual tax impact if the bond passes. This was a critical feature for transparency, moving the discussion from abstract numbers to a tangible, personal calculation for voters.

The result is a clean, professional, and mobile-responsive website that functions as the single source of truth the client envisioned. The site successfully launched and is actively serving the Lynden community by providing:

- A Custom-Built Tax Calculator: A key tool that empowers homeowners by providing personalized financial impact data.
- A Neutral Information Hub: The site successfully avoids a promotional "campaign" feel, focusing instead on clearly presenting facts, FAQs, and official data.
- A "Go-To" Resource: The site is now the primary "off-ramp" for community members on social media, giving them an accessible, credible place to get answers instead of engaging in debate.

While the final bond vote has not yet occurred, the project was a complete success in terms of delivering a high-quality, custom-built resource that directly met the client's strategic goals.
